# Heart-Disease-Diagnostic-Analysis and Prediction Project
The goal of this project is to analyse the heart disease occurrence, based on a combination of features that describes the heart disease.



The objective of this project is to check whether the patient is likely to be diagnosed with any cardiovascular heart diseases based on their medical attributes such as gender, age, chest pain, fasting sugar level, etc.



 Exploratory Data Analysis: Correlations, Violin & Box Plots, Filtering data by positive & negative Heart Disease patient





Machine Learning + Predictive Analytics: Prepare Data for Modeling, Modeling/Training, Confusion Matrix, Feature Importance, Predictions‍ ‍ ‍ ‍






Conclusions
1. Out of the 13 features we examined, the top 4 significant features that helped us classify between a positive & negative Diagnosis were chest pain type (cp), maximum heart rate achieved (thalach), number of major vessels (ca), and ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (oldpeak).



2. Our machine learning algorithm can now classify patients with Heart Disease. Now we can properly diagnose patients, & get them the help they needs to recover. By diagnosing detecting these features early, we may prevent worse symptoms from arising later.



3. Our Random Forest algorithm yields the highest accuracy, 80%. Any accuracy above 70% is considered good, but be careful because if your accuracy is extremely high, it may be too good to be true (an example of Over fitting). Thus, 90% is the ideal accuracy!‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍
